This paper applies **geometric statistics** to analyze shape differences in brain structures between Alzheimer’s patients and healthy controls.  
Using **Kendall’s shape space**, **Fréchet means**, and **energy-distance permutation testing**, the project demonstrates how advanced statistical modeling can uncover subtle geometric patterns in medical imaging data.

## Paper Overview

Traditional Euclidean methods distort geometric data because they ignore rotation, translation, and scaling.  
Here, brain structures (specifically the **corpus callosum**) are analyzed as points on a **nonlinear manifold**, enabling more accurate and interpretable results.

This analysis of:
- Implements **Fréchet mean estimation** for shape averaging on manifolds  
- Uses **energy-distance permutation tests** to assess statistical differences between groups  
- Applies **hierarchical clustering** to explore structure in high-dimensional shape distances  
- Validates methods on **simulated shape data** (hands, hammers, glasses) before analyzing real brain MRI data from the **ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)** dataset
